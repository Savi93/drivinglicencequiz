# drivinglicencequiz

On the main page of our system, the user can decide whether to login/register or enter as a guest. By logging in, the user is redirected to a page with a menu, where he has several options:
•	Start a new quiz (which randomly selects 40 different questions from the database);
•	Change the password or delete the account (settings);
•	See the statistics of the previous resolved quizzes (check the average of errors, the number of performed quizzes etc.).
If the user is not registered, he/she can either register himself, by entering name, e-Mail and password credentials, or to continue as guest; obviously, after the registration, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to his e-mail address.
The guest (not logged as user) can only choose to start a new quiz or see the statistics of that session only (the settings menu is clearly not available).
The quiz respects the Italian Highway Code and is composed by 40 true-false questions and the user has 30 minutes to complete the quiz. 
Within the quiz frame, the user can check the errors in a completed quiz, restart with a new quiz or leave the page to check its statistics.
